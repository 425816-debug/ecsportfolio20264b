	<p>MY DANCE JOURNEY</p>
			><p>As I said above, I started dance when I was only 4 years old and when I was little I always wanted to become a dancer. I started dancing at Tanner Dance down at the University of Utah which focused on teaching dance to little kids and helping them grow. I then went to Ballet west where I continued to dance until I was 9 years old. Throughout this time I was focused on only ballet because that was the only style offered at the studio. I think that Ballet West helped me become a better dancer through dicipline and I also auditioned for things like the Nutcracker during my time there. Once covid hit, I moved to School of Dance where I spent my time from then until last year. It was very new for me because it offered styles and classes that I had never tried before. However the next year I auditioned for the Company there and made it onto one of the teams titled PINK COMPANY. After that I continued to audition and got onto better companies until last year when I made it onto the highest one BLUE COMPANY. I didn't know that they were introding yet another company called COLLECTIVE which was the most advanced one geared towards "proffesionals". Later that summer after being in blue company I received an email saying that I made it onto COLLECTIVE which is one of the most memorable things about being at that studio. Being in COLLECTIVE meant that it was more commitment and hors but I was ready to take a step up so I decided to do it. Throughout the year I was dancing 4-5 hours almost every day which was a lot for me. Despit that I made so many memories and I definitley progressed as a dancer and a person. Some of my favorite times have been with the people in my COLLECTIVE COMPANY weather it was our performances, recitals, classes, or just hanging out. This goes to show how much dance has impacted my life and how many memories I have made during the proccess. Now I am at a studio called ELITE because I was ready to move onto a studio that could help me become more proffessional but as of now I am just taking rec classes.<p/>
		<p>WHO HAS HELPED ME GET HERE</p>
			><p>Many people have helped my get me to where I am today as a person but esspecially a dancer. My parents have always supported me as a dancer and showed up to all of my performances, showcases, and recitals just so they could see me dance which is one of the reasons I have such a passion for dance. I think it is important for me to be able to show off my hardwork to people and seeing how much my parent care makes my want to keep dancing. Along with that many of my teachers have taught me so much about teh world of dance and made me a better dancer/performer. One specific teacher that really helped me was a teacher I had when I was in TEAL COMPANY. She was only there for one year but during that year I progressed the most and she always gave me tips to improve.</p>
